<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>ОБНОВЛЕНИЕ</strong> <strong>I</strong> <strong>и</strong> <strong>II</strong> <strong>раздела</strong></p>
<p>Есть файл full_data_precise_original на котором делались последние расчеты для аналитики. И есть новый файл data_website_revised - это файл для анализа институций с улучшенной припиской аффилиаций и с включением строк, где организация не идентифицирована (Unknown&nbsp;or&nbsp;Uni&nbsp;&lt; 10) для точной фракционализации.</p>
<p>Для обновления <strong>I</strong> <strong>и</strong> <strong>II</strong> <strong>раздела</strong>, как я вижу, нужно сначала сделать следующее с файлами.</p>
<p>Мы опираемся на очищенный full_data_precise_original, но сейчас после дополнительной чистки немного поменялись значения в переменных organisation_full и country. Тогда я бы сделала так:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>в full_data_precise_original заменила бы значения переменных organisation_full и country на значения переменных organisation_full и country из файла data_website_revised - СДЕЛАНО ✅</p></li>
<li><p>проверила бы значения region – так как могли быть идентифицированы новые строки и нужно посмотреть, чтобы им приписался регион. - СДЕЛАНО ✅</p></li>
</ol>
<p>ЧТОБЫ НЕ ЗАБЫТЬ! в новом получившимся датасете имя конкретного автора не совадает с его институцией. То есть у нас есть статья с тремя соавторами.</p>
<p>Но общее кол-во строчек и институций / стран сохранияется. просто фамилии теперь перемешаны</p>

<p>Fig 1 Использованы сущности, где статья записана одной строчкой, а не многими в случае многих авторов. Без фракционализации по SSCI или AHCI. Если исследовательская область выглядит как список, [‘SSCI’, ‘AHCI’], тогда публикация дублируется и считается как +1 публикация для каждой из областей в списке.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>На Fig 1 видно, что публикации в [‘SSCI’] на протяжение 1990-2007 годов варьировались в диапазоне до ~400 публикаций в год. После 2008 года рубеж в 400 публикаций стабильно преодолен и количество публикаций в год нарастало вплоть до ~600 в 2020.</p>

<p>Fig 2 Использовать сущность, где статья записана одной строчкой, а не многими в случае многих авторов. Однако сделать фракционализацию на число областей. Если статья принадлежала 3 областям, то сделать 0,3 – по такому принципу. По SSCI или AHCI фракционализацию не делать.</p>

<p>Из Fig 2 хорошо видно структуру Рашн стадис. Видно, что по политологии, экономики, истории и литературе написан основной массив всех текстов за 1990-2020.</p>

<p>Fig 4a и Fig 4b – все отлично, только сделать фракционализацию по областям. Использовать сущность, где статья записана одной строчкой, а не многими в случае многих авторов. Однако сделать фракционализацию на число областей. Если статья принадлежала 3 областям, то сделать 0,3 – по такому принципу. Оставить динамичную ось.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>На Fig 4a и Fig 4b видно, что История сильно приросла в процентах от всех областей. Так же доля социологии, лингвистики и философии приросли. Доли Арт и литературы снизились. Очень стабильную долю на за 1990-2020 держит только политология (в районе 20%). На самом деле еще экономика, кроме всплеска доли в конце 90-х (может интерес вызван исследованиям кризиса 1998)</p>

<p>Fig 5a и Fig 5b Использовать сущность, где статья записана одной строчкой, а не многими в случае многих авторов. Если статья принадлежит нескольким регионам, то присвоить каждому региону статью. То есть не фракционализировать. То есть не должно быть ситуации, когда у статьи 5 авторов из России, и это 5 строчек в базе, это должна остаться 1 строчка.</p>

<p><code>Other</code> это <code>Africa</code>, <code>Americas</code>, <code>Oceania</code>.</p>
<p>Основной массив текстов раньше писался в США. Но доля США стабильно падала, доля России и Европы и Азии растет. Доля США падает не потому что они стали писать меньше статей, они пишут столько же. Это просто Россия и Европа в штуках стали больше писать.</p>

<p>Fig 6 Использовать сущность, где статья записана одной строчкой, а не многими в случае многих авторов. Если статья принадлежит нескольким регионам, то присвоить каждому региону статью. То есть не фракционализировать. То есть не должно быть ситуации, когда у статьи 5 авторов из России, и это 5 строчек в базе, это должна остаться 1 строчка. Однако фракционализировать на число областей, то есть если статья России принадлежала 2 областям, то записать их по 0,5.</p>
<p>ПРИМЕР: У WOS:A1995QJ42600001 три соавтора их двух регионов. У статьи через ; две исследовательские области. Региону А в Oбласть I падает 0.5 и в Oбласть II падает 0.5. Региону В в Oбласть I падает 0.5 и в Oбласть II падает 0.5.</p>

<p>На Fig 6 в глаза бросается относительная большая специализация России на Философии, социологии, а так же относительно большая специализация США на литературе. У России в структуре относительно мало Истории, а у США экономики.</p>

<p>Fig 7 Использовать сущность, где статья записана одной строчкой, а не многими в случае многих авторов. Если статья принадлежит нескольким регионам, то присвоить каждому региону статью. То есть не фракционализировать. То есть не должно быть ситуации, когда у статьи 5 авторов из России, и это 5 строчек в базе, это должна остаться 1 строчка. Однако фракционализировать на число областей, то есть если статья России принадлежала 2 областям, то записать их по 0,5.</p>

<p>На Fig 7 видим, что скачек доли экономических статей это в основном российский регион. Видим странный скачек Арт публикаций в России в 2005-2006. Видим планомерный рост доли истории у США. Видим странный горб по философии в 2001-2007 в России. Ну и обвал доли публикаций по политологии в России начиная с 2013. Все остальные доли в России, США и Европе кажутся относительно стабильными.</p>

<p>Fig 8a Использовать сущность, где статья записана одной строчкой, а не многими в случае многих авторов. Если статья принадлежит нескольким регионам, то присвоить каждому региону статью. То есть не фракционализировать. То есть не должно быть ситуации, когда у статьи 5 авторов из России, и это 5 строчек в базе, это должна остаться 1 строчка. Однако фракционализировать на число областей, то есть если статья России принадлежала 2 областям, то записать их по 0,5.</p>

<p>Россия из всех дисциплин серьезный вклад вносит в образование, философию, социологию и урбан (мало наблюдений) - авторы из России участвовали в написании от четверти и более всех публикаций в этих областях.</p>
