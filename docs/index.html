<p>На Fig 1 видно, что публикации в [‘SSCI’] на протяжение 1990-2007 годов варьировались в диапазоне до ~400 публикаций в год. После 2008 года рубеж в 400 публикаций стабильно преодолен и количество публикаций в год нарастало вплоть до ~600 в 2020.</p>

<p>Из Fig 2 хорошо видно структуру Рашн стадис. Видно, что по политологии, экономики, истории и литературе написан основной массив всех текстов за 1990-2020. Но динамика считывается тут плохо, посмотрим на Fig 3, из которого видно, что История сильно приросла в процентах от всех областей. Так же доля социологии, лингвистики и философии приросли. Доли Арт и литературы снизились. Очень стабильную долю на за 1990-2020 держит только политология (в районе 20%). На самом деле еще экономика, кроме всплеска доли в конце 90-х (может интерес вызван исследованиям кризиса 1998)</p>

<p>Это то же самое что доли из (2b), просто наглядно в динамике. Из графиков ниже мы видим, что в SSCI основное это политология и экономика, доли ведут себя очень стабильно, кроме всплеска доли экономики в конце 90%. В AHCI видна смена подобластей - доля Арт и литературы со временем снижается, доля истории и философии наоборот растет. В комбо SSCI + AHCI снижается Area Stud.</p>

<p>Основной массив текстов раньше писался в США (рис А). Но доля США стабильно падала, доля России и Европы и Азии растет (рис С). Для США падает не потому что они стали писать меньше статей, они пишут столько же (рис. В). Это просто Россия и Европа в штуках стали больше писать.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="специализация-регионов">4. Специализация регионов</h2>
<p>На рис А в глаза бросается относительная большая специализация России на Философии? (это ЛОГОС???))))) социологии, а так же относительно большая специализация США на литературе. У России в структуре относительно мало Истории, а у США экономики.</p>
<p>На рис В мало что видно, он перерисован и на рис С уже динамика представлена отдельными линиями. Благодаря рис С видим, что скачек доли экономических статей это в основном российский регион. Видим странный скачек Арт публикаций в России в 2005-2006. Видим планомерный рост доли истории у США. Видим странный горб по философии в 2001-2007 в России. Ну и обвал доли публикаций по политологии в России начиная с 2013. Все остальные доли в России, США и Европе кажутся относительно стабильными.</p>
