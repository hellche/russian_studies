<p>На Fig 1 видно, что публикации в [‘SSCI’] на протяжение 1990-2007 годов варьировались в диапазоне до ~400 публикаций в год. После 2008 года рубеж в 400 публикаций стабильно преодолен и количество публикаций в год нарастало вплоть до ~600 в 2020.</p>

<p>На Fig 4a и Fig 4b видно, что История сильно приросла в процентах от всех областей. Так же доля социологии, лингвистики и философии приросли. Доли Арт и литературы снизились. Очень стабильную долю на за 1990-2020 держит только политология (в районе 20%). На самом деле еще экономика, кроме всплеска доли в конце 90-х (может интерес вызван исследованиям кризиса 1998)</p>

<p>Основной массив текстов раньше писался в США. Но доля США стабильно падала, доля России и Европы и Азии растет. Доля США падает не потому что они стали писать меньше статей, они пишут столько же. Это просто Россия и Европа в штуках стали больше писать.</p>

<p>На Fig 7 видим, что скачек доли экономических статей это в основном российский регион. Видим странный скачек Арт публикаций в России в 2005-2006. Видим планомерный рост доли истории у США. Видим странный горб по философии в 2001-2007 в России. Ну и обвал доли публикаций по политологии в России начиная с 2013. Все остальные доли в России, США и Европе кажутся относительно стабильными.</p>
