<p>Impact of Publications Для всего раздела. Использовать сущность, где статья записана одной строчкой, а не многими в случае многих авторов. Если статья принадлежит нескольким регионам, то присвоить каждому региону статью. То есть не фракционализировать. То есть не должно быть ситуации, когда у статьи 5 авторов из России, и это 5 строчек в базе, это должна остаться 1 строчка.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="группы-институций-показатели-51020-лучших">5. Группы институций: показатели 5/10/20 лучших</h2>
<p>Средние значения показателей по группам институций в динамике: 5,10,20 лучших, все остальные. Показатели MNSC, средняя цитируемость на статью. Линиями на графиках, а группы – это 5,10,20 лучших.</p>
<p><strong>Важно:</strong> 5 лучших в 1990 и 1991 это не обязательно одни и те же институции. В графиках показаны топы институций в каждый конкретный год. Фракционализация не производилась. Рисунки построены как лучшие по <code>TC</code> и <code>mncs</code> в каждый конкретный год. На рисунке мы фактически видим среднее средних.</p>
<p>По шагам: В 1990 году для каждой институции мы считаем <code>среднее TC</code>. выбираем топ 5 институций, у котрых самый высокий <code>средний TC</code> в 1990. Для этих 5 институции мы счимтаем <code>средннее средних TC</code>. Таким образом мы получаем точку, которая сейчас отображена на графике в 1990 для группы топ 5 лучших. Чтобы получить топ 10 мы берем для 10 лучших <code>средннее средних TC</code> (5 институций у нас те же самые что и в топ 5). Для топ 20 по тому же принципу (в топ 20 входит топ 5 и 10). Группа “все остальные” это от топ 21 места до самой последней институции. Для каждого года всё рассчитывается по новой. Для <code>mncs</code> всё считается отдельно по тому же принципу. На вкладках <code>Таблица_ТС/mncs</code> можно посмотреть конкретные значения более подробно.</p>
